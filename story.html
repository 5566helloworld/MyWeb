                    <p>A long time ago, on this ancient continent, an energy substance was discovered that
                      some claimed was a remnant of the God particle from the ancient times when God
                      created the world and could provide unlimited energy.</p>
                    <p>It had been buried for a long
                      time, but one day it was discovered by chance, but because it could not be dug up, it
                      was only marked, and the news caused an uproar among the academic elite of the
                      world. The four nations on this continent set out to obtain the God Particle, one by
                      one, with their own armies, in a bid to seize it, and a world war began.</p>

                    <h1><b>Republic of Goliath</b></h1>
                    <p>Magic, technology - these elements are common in this landlocked
                      country and do not conflict with each other at all. The Republic of
                      Goliath came into being in the 15th century after the hanging of the
                      infamous King Lucius, and began a prosperous industrial revolution and
                      foreign trade, with workers pouring barrels and barrels of</p>
                    <p>For the Goliaths, it was commonplace to enjoy the magic of riding in
                      gas carriages and tapping their fingers to light cigarettes, and the logic
                      of coal-fired automata was not incompatible with the mystery of magic.
                      At the same time, magical schools and technical colleges have always
                      provided the nation with talent, from performing evil sacrifices on the
                      battlefield to enhance metal tanks powered by magic stones without the
                      knowledge of the Church, to artificial rainfall in the Republic, the
                      coexistence of technology and magic has always been a strength of the
                      nation.</p>
                    <p>Religion and God have always been present in this scientific nation, and
                      from the horrors of the House of Lucius to the Republican period of the
                      Industrial Revolution, the Church has remained neutral, providing help
                      to the poor and cultivating God's servants. Recently, the Church's
                      preachers found an artefact in the Plain of Kanker that overturned the
                      Church's beliefs and in order to cover it up, the Church asked the
                      Council to go on an expedition to remove the blasphemous artefact
                      from the name of God. The Council also wanted to prove to its
                      neighbours that it was strong after the Industrial Revolution by going to
                      the Plain of Kanker, so both sides agreed to go to war and so the
                      bloody battle on the Plain of Kanker began.</p>

                    <p>In order to win the war, a group of cultists and the Ministry of Defence have
                      made a private agreement to exchange the souls of condemned prisoners with
                      demons to obtain an extremely powerful team of evil powers. As a former
                      Republican soldier with blood on his hands, he is so desperate to kill that the
                      army has to deploy him to the front of the line to prevent him from hurting his
                      own men. Of course, the price of trading with the devil is that the squad's sanity
                      will be worn away in one kill after another until they die, and their souls will
                      then become the devil's fuel, so they will always be trapped in an endless war,
                      and death is the only place they will end up. As for Calamity, he was looking
                      forward to the great battle at the Plain of Kanker.</p>

                      was assassinated by noblemen who seized control of the country from the royal
                      family. For Angel, she has never known her birth. Her adoptive father, Pierre,
                      the former first scientist of the Empire, saved Angel as a baby from the palace
                      massacre, thus saving the daughter of the Queen, the last of the Empire's
                      magical bloodline. They fled to the Republic of Goliath, where they stayed
                      together for the rest of their lives. To help her, he designed a set of magic-
                      powered wings that made Angel a true Valkyrie. When the Kanker Campaign
                      begins, Angel is ordered by the Republic to join it. She is excited to go to war,
                      not knowing that she will be slaughtering her former people on the battlefield.</p>

                    <h1><b>Greinch Empire</b></h1>
                    <p>"Glory to the Queen", a phrase that every citizen of the Greinch
                      Empire must have heard. As they worked in the dangerous refining of
                      whale oil, as they worked all night with their children in the textile mills,
                      this phrase was at the end of every broadcast. It was illegal to stop the
                      radio and refuse to listen to it in the Empire, and serious cases were sent
                      to the northern mines for life, where the people-centred Queen was the
                      Queen's head on their hard-earned coins. Police posts were scattered
                      throughout the cities, ports and factories of any empire, on the outskirts
                      of cities and even on outlying islands far from the gathering places, the
                      broadcasting systems and automatic turrets that stood in the streets and
                      fields to guard and monitor the behaviour of every citizen, who was
                      registered at birth in the central information system of the capital, the
                      barrel-driven punch cards that recorded the information of every citizen,
                      the differential machines that calculated the potential of every The
                      dumb and the dumber are fed from an early age with repetitive
                      processes under iron skins, while those with potential are educated to
                      become engineers or police officers.</p>
                    <p>As for the managers of this high-pressure country, they spend their days
                      in the rich neighbourhoods, enjoying the privileges of the elite, who are
                      not created equal, so it is only natural that they accept this fact and
                      manage the main political and business affairs of the empire. Of course,
                      there must have been people who could not stand the high levels of
                      work, who rebelled and the police went to suppress them, not once or
                      twice anyway. The metal armoured vehicles assembled from the
                      bloodied hands of the workers would burn whale oil to crush the
                      workers who had assembled them, and the workers themselves would
                      never have a chance to touch their bosses.</p>

                    <p>The House family, which provides the Empire's vital energy and is also the largest shareholder in
                      the Imperial Armed Forces, is a family of cannibals who have squeezed countless workers out of
                      the Empire, and the family's youngest son, Corrad, is one of the few who cares about his workers.
                      As opposed to his own spendthrift family, Kreider would stoop to inspect the workers in the
                      factory, so when the whale-oil factory overloaded and exploded, his workers risked their lives to
                      rescue Corrad from the flames. With 90% of his body burnt, Corrad is stuffed by his family into
                      the latest exoskeleton armour designed by the military. The iron coffin restores Corrad 's
                      mobility, but the pain of the burns warps his sanity. He hates his brutal and cold-blooded family,
                      and he hates the cold-blooded machinery of the state, after all, the very system that gave the
                      Haus family the right to exploit them, and they are all responsible for the factory accident. The
                      God Particle is his weapon of choice to overthrow the country, and he wants to seize this ancient
                      artefact to overthrow this twisted nation.</p>

                      hammer that can smash the brains out of anyone who sees it. The Black
                      Gauntlet is a legendary terror on the battlefield because no one has ever lived
                      to see it in its full glory. The Iron Man himself was the secret weapon of the

                      crafted power hammer that turned the wearer into a super soldier. The armour's
                      high cost made it a unique weapon for fighting morale. His drivers have passed
                      from generation to generation, becoming the vanguard of the Empire's warriors,

                      cities in Genesia were freed from the bonds of gravity, and many cities
                      joined them to become a kingdom in the sky. The original people of
                      Genesia loved the arts and opera. There was hardly a person in the
                      capital who could not sing, and their love of theatre and entertainment
                      led them to invite musicians and artists from all over the world to
                      become inhabitants of the Sky Kingdom. Thanks to the early God
                      particle engine, which gave them unlimited energy, and the
                      development of automated technology, the people of the city have been
                      involved in the arts and sciences for almost all of their lives, and magic
                      has only been used to complement their artistic performances. As for
                      the terrestrial nations, many of them challenged the status of the Sky
                      Kingdom, but their mastery of air conversion technology enabled them
                      to produce tens of thousands of tonnes of chlorine gas to easily destroy
                      the opposing terrestrial nations.</p>
                    <p>Recently, some of the other nations on the ground have unearthed
                      additional God particles in the Plain of Kanker. The Sky Kingdom
                      intercepted this information in a deal with the Earth, and their House of
                      Representatives immediately authorized military action against the Plain
                      of Kanker. For the only Sky Kingdom , they are determined not to allow
                      another Sky Kingdom to be created, so they are determined to win the
                      Plain of Kanker.</p>

                    <h1>Andymea</h1>
                    <p>âAs a magical noble of the Republic of Goliath, Andymea was brought up by
                      her parents to live in the Sky Kingdom, where her magic could only be used for
                      performance in the peaceful place. She was born into a noble family and was
                      determined to make a name for herself in the Kingdom of Heaven, rather than
                      become a performer who could be seen everywhere. With her magical talents,
                      she was able to secure a position in the Warlocks' Ministry. During this time she
                      met the Holy Maiden, Ekasia, who taught her some protective magic as
                      Andiamia's predecessor. So during the Kanker War, Andymea seized the
                      opportunity to become their warlock, the Grand Wizard, and fight for glory!</p>

                    <h1>Ekasia</h1>
                    <p>The Sky Kingdom, a nation with the most advanced technology available to mankind,
                      has long disregarded the gods, so when a young girl, Ekasia, is born by a miracle,
                      she becomes a dissident in the nation. She has no father, and her mother seems to
                      know that, as the holy scriptures say, she pregnant when she was virgin, so when
                      Ekasia is born, both mother and daughter are discriminated against by everyone.
                      Strong and determined to prove her miracle, and to show those who mocked and
                      despised her the greatness of the Creator, Ekasia joined the Warlocks to practise
                      her magic and to do her best to fulfil the teachings of the Canon and help the poor
                      people around her. Since the beginning of the Kanker War, Ekasia has signed up to
                      become a medic, proving the existence of the miracle by helping wounded soldiers.
                      In a brutal war, the truth is that God has not favoured anyone.</p>

                    <h1><b>Rosa Syndica Alliance</b></h1>
                    <p>In the far north of the Eurasian continent lies a primitive land, covered
                      in snow and ice all year round, where goods are scarce and the
                      environment is harsh. The Slavs have a primitive life there, and in order
                      to survive the hardships, they have the most devout faith in the cruel
                      gods of nature. The Arctic is a vast country and the Slavs are therefore
                      divided into different tribes, the three largest of which have their own
                      distinctive characteristics.</p>
                    <p>The Woodlanders, who wielded the primordial power of earth and wood,
                      and who, by the grace of their Mother of Trees, knew how to control
                      plants and use the walls of roots to protect themselves and produce
                      food.</p>
                    <p>The Moonchasers, the most brutal and violent of the Slavs, hunt and
                        pillage for a living, and some of them forcibly change their bodies by
                        drawing on the magic of the moon to become transmitted centaurs and
                      werewolves.</p>
                    <p>The Arabs, located in the inhabitable zone of the Arctic Circle, were
                      originally the most skilled of the Slavic peoples in commerce and trade,
                      learning about the civilised world through foreign trade and gradually
                      building their own city-states and civilisations, using ancient magic and
                      the flexibility of technology to improve their lives.</p>
                    <p>The tribes were separated from each other until the Sky Kingdom
                      arrived from afar and slaughtered the Slavic continent for the rare God
                      particle in the Arctic Circle. The tribes suffered heavy losses during the
                      cataclysm, and in order to fight off foreign enemies, the chiefs, shamans
                      and leaders of each tribe came together to unite the remaining forces of
                      each tribe and form the Rosa Syndica Alliance.</p>

                    <h1>Hulse</h1>
                    <p>No one has ever seen Hulse's true face, a half-horse shifter who wears silver
                      armour even in camp, under which he rarely speaks. Some say he is a hunter
                      from the Woodland clan who knows how to use nature to his advantage to
                      ambush his enemies, while others say he is an orphan from the holocaust,
                      adopted by the Moonchaser clan as a child, who understands the language of
                      the beasts and controls their charge. This half-horse shifter, who could control
                      the power of earth and wood and the power of fierce beasts, became one of the
                      most elite warriors of the Rosa Syndica Alliance, a cunning barbarian for the
                      enemy and a hope in desperate times for the friendlies. So for the battle of the
                      Kanker, this silver shadow will once again turn the tide.</p>

                    <h1>Falcon</h1>
                    <p>After the devastation of the Rosa Syndica Alliance in the air, the representatives of the
                      Arabs pointed out the disadvantages of the Alliance in terms of air weapons. The Alliance
                      therefore eagerly reversed the armour left behind by the Sky Kingdom in the hope of
                      producing units that could also fight in the air. As a result, the first air squad was formed,
                      thanks to the best efforts of the scientists. The leader of the squad, the Falcon, was the
                      perfect match for the Iron Wings, displaying an amazing talent for flying among a squad
                      with no previous flying experience, and being a muscle-bound Moonchaser who retained
                      a great mind and excellent leadership and command skills, he deservedly became the
                      leader of the squad. So when they go into action on the Plain of Kanker, they will also
                      take direct orders from the Alliance Council in the form of a special squad and carry out
                      decapitation operations against their enemies. For their enemies, the black shadows in
                      the air will be the last thing they see.</p>
