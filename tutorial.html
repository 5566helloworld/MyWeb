            <p>The player's objective is to occupy the capture point and gained the capture score.
              Of course, you can also employ various means to eliminate enemy units or slay enemy
              heroes. However, simultaneously, you must also be mindful of protecting your own controlled
              hero because once they are slain, you lose the game.</p>
            <p><b>Victory Conditions (Achieve any one of the following):</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Gain 3 capture points.</li>
                <li>Be the last surviving player.</li>

            <h1><b>Preparation</b></h1>
            <ol>
              <li>Before the game begins players roll dice to determine the turn order and place map
                tiles accordingly. Then, players draw different map fragments. They can assemble a
                3x3 map by arranging these fragments around the map tiles they possess. Players can
                rotate the map to determine terrain as well as the positions of treasure points and
                supply depots, thereby formulating different strategies. (Note: Map tiles with capture
                points must be in the center.)</li>
              <li>After players have finalized the terrain, they can choose their hero and recruit soldiers
                using the initial funding provided by the hero.</li>
              <li>Place teh faction identification base under the soldier pawns and on the soldier cards, and place the hero
                at their initial point to begin the game.</li>

            <h1><b>Game Procedure and Specific Rules</b></h1>
            <h3><b>Turn Sturcture</b></h3>
            <p>Each turn proceeds in the same order. After the end of the player, the turn will be
              passed to the next player according to the order.</p>
            <p><b> >Start stage</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>At this stage, if any of your unit is in the capture point, you can get 1 capture score.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b> >Action stage</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Action Points</b><br>
                  <br>Each player has 3 action points for each turn. Action taken by a player will
                  cost them 1 action point, including: "setting up soldier", "moving soldier and attacking",
                  "moving hero and attacking", and "using hero skills". Each time an action is taken as
                  above, one action point is deducted and when the action points for the turn are
                  exhausted, it goes into the End Stage.
                </li>
                <div class="container">
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-sm-8">
                            <li><b>Moving Pawns</b><br>
                              <br>A player can control the movement of his own pawn, which can only be made in a vertical
                              direction, not in an angled direction. A pawn can only move within its maximum movement range,
                              for example, if the movement range is 4, then it is allowed to move 0-4 paces but no more than 4
                              steps. After moving, the unit can can attack any enemy unit within its attack range,
                              or just end its moving action, then cost one action point. The same rules apply to the movement
                              of heroes as above.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Attack Action and Damge Calculation</b><br>
                              <br>Attack range is calculated based on vertical movement, not angled movement. The damage dealt
                              by an attack is based on the combined attack power of the unit, equipment cards and hero's skills.
                              <br>
                              <br>When a unit takes damage, place the corresponding damage counter on the corresponding unit card.
                              When a unit's HP reaches 0 or below, it is considered eliminated. Remove the corresponding pawn from the board,
                              discard the unit card, and discard the equipping equipment card. If a hero's HP reaches 0 or below,
                              the player is considered out of the game, and all units controlled by that player are removed from the board.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Counter Attack</b><br>
                              <br>If the attacked unit's attack range includes the unit initiating the attack, a counter attack is
                              triggered. When receiving damage, the attacking unit also receives a counter attack calculation.
                              The counter attack rules for heroes are the same as above.
                            </li>

                <li><b>Soldier</b><br>
                  <br>Each player can have a maximum of 4 soldier. Each soldier has its own faction identification base,
                  which has a symbol and different colors on it to help identify and track the damage taken of the soldier.
                  The base have symbols 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , which is used to identifies which soldier pawn on the field
                  belong to. These faction identification base appear on both the soldier pieces and the soldier cards, with
                  the soldier pawn placed on the board and the corresponding soldier cards placed in the player's place.
                  The cards show the type of soldier, attack power, HP, attack range and movement range.<br>
                  <a href="cards_soldier.html">Further detail of soldier can be seen in this page.</a>

                <li><b>Deploying Soldier</b><br>
                  <br>The player can spend one action point and the corresponding funds to recruit a soldier at the initial point.
                </li>
                <li><b>Using Hero's Active Skill</b><br>
                  <br>During a player‘s turn, the player can spend one action point to use the hero’s active skill. After using an
                  active skill, the hero cannot move again and the player must place a cooldown indicator on the hero card that
                  corresponds to the hero‘s active skill cooldown. At the end stage, the cooldown indicator is counted down by 1.
                  If the count is reduced to 0, the cooldown indicator is removed. The player can only use active skills when the
                  hero does not have a cooldown indicator.
                </li>
                <li><b>Using Treasure Card</b><br>
                  <br>During the player's turn, the player can use any treasure card without spending action point.<br>

                </li>
                <li><b>Triggering Treasure Points / Supply Points</b><br>
                  <br>During a player's turn, when a unit stop on a treasure/supply point, a terrain effect is triggered after the attack has
                  been calculated. A unit that is already on the same treasure point/supply point must leave the terrain before the
                  terrain effect can be triggered again.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>>End Stage</b></p>
            <ul>
